# ON! A Mobile Remote Command App for Android

This Android application was developed as a learning exercise to explore fundamental concepts within native Android development. The primary goal was to gain practical experience with:

* **Screens:** Implementing and managing different user interface screens.
* **Navigation:** Handling transitions and flow between different parts of the application.
* **Variables:** Understanding and utilizing different variable types and scopes within Compose.
* **Compose Elements:** Working with various composable functions and their properties.
* **States and Changes:** Managing UI state and responding to state changes within the Compose framework.

## Technology Stack

This app leverages the traditional Android stack with the following key components:

* **Jetpack Compose:** A modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android UIs.
* **SQLite:** A lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process.
* **Room Persistence Library:** An abstraction layer over SQLite that provides fluent database access while utilizing the full power of SQLite.
* **Monolithic Database Structure:** The application employs a single, self-contained database for all its data needs.

This project serves as a foundational exploration of these technologies and their integration within a simple Android application.
